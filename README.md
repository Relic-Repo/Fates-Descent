    <h2 align="left">Description</h2>
    <div align="center" style="margin: 100 auto; padding: 20px;">
        <strong>Fate's Descent</strong> is a dynamic and immersive module designed for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, enhancing gameplay by introducing a comprehensive system of sanity and madness mechanics. The module meticulously tracks sanity points and introduces various levels of madness, each with unique effects that influence character behavior and abilities. Players can experience short-term and long-term madness, with effects ranging from mild disturbances to severe, mind-altering conditions. The module integrates seamlessly with character sheets, providing visual indicators for sanity and madness levels, and automates the application of effects through interactive dialogs and rollable tables. Fate's Descent elevates the role-playing experience, adding depth and complexity to character development and storytelling. With robust settings for customization, game masters can tailor the madness mechanics to fit their campaign's tone and intensity, ensuring an engaging and challenging adventure for all participants.

    <h3 align="left">Fate's Descent: Expanding the D&D5e System with Sanity and Madness</h3>
    <br>
        <div>
        <p align="center">Fate's Descent introduces two new metrics to the D&D5e system, expanding the optional rules for Madness found in the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) on page 258.
        </p>
        </div>
<h4 align="left">Sanity Points</h4>
    <br>
    <div>    
    <p align="center">The first of these metrics is Sanity Points, which are akin to Hit Points but represent a character's mental fortitude. Sanity Points are recovered similarly to Hit Points using Hit Dice. During rest periods, players can choose to use some of their Hit Dice for Sanity Point recovery.
    <br>
    By default, each character begins with an initial 28 Sanity Points, bolstered by their Sanity Modifier. These points do not increase with level, although customization by the Game Master (GM) is possible, and features may be added to increase this amount.
    <br>
    Maintaining a healthy amount of Sanity Points becomes imperative with the introduction of the second metric. As characters lose Sanity Points, Madness Points begin to accumulate if not "healed." The rate of accumulation increases as Sanity Points are further reduced.
    </p>
    
<h4 align="left">Madness Points</h4>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p align="center">The second metric, Madness Points, represents the effects of sanity damage. Every character starts with 10 Madness Points, plus their Sanity Modifier, which serves a dual purpose: increasing capacity and providing an early-stage buffer against the effects of accumulated Madness.
    <br>
    </p>

<h4 align="left">Phases of Madness</h4>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p align="center">Madness progresses through five phases, ranging from mild inconvenience to the character becoming an NPC at the final phase. These phases are evenly spaced across the Madness Points, with the final phase at the very end.
    <br>
    </div>

<h4 align="left">Reducing Madness Points</h4>
    <br>
    <div>
    <p align="center">Currently, there are three ways to reduce Madness Points:
        <ul>
            <li>Greater Restoration: This spell lowers a character's Madness Points by two levels (four points by default).
            <li>Short Term Madness Roll Table: Rolling voluntarily on this table imposes Insanity Effects lasting 1 to 10 minutes, reducing Madness Points by 1.
            <li>Long Term Madness Roll Table: Rolling voluntarily on this table imposes more severe Insanity Effects lasting 10 to 100 hours, reducing Madness Points by 3.
By incorporating these new mechanics, Fate's Descent deepens the role-playing experience, challenging characters to maintain their mental fortitude while facing the horrors of their adventures.
